# The 30k chrome extension

This extension is available on the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/30k/olbpglaibapheinfojhgiaenneioilpn).

This chrome extension takes an unconventional approach to fighting procrastination, based on the principle that we are given about 30,000 days to live. Each time a user opens a new tab, they are shown the number of days they have lived (out of 30k), graphically with a progress bar. This app serves as a reminder that life is transient and ever unfolding. Time is our most valuable resource, so why waste it!

I built this chrome extension for fun over winter break '18. This app was inspired by [Drew Houston's MIT commencement address](https://youtu.be/6inri5ggyK4), and the principles of [memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori)

This app was built in React.js!
